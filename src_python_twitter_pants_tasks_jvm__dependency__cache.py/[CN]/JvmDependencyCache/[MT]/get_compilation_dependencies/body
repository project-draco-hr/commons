def get_compilation_dependencies(self):
    '\n    Computes a map from the source files in a target to class files that the source file\n    depends on.\n\n    Note: this code currently relies on the relations report generated by the zinc incremental\n    scala compiler. If other languages/compilers want to use this code, they need to provide\n    a similar report. See zinc_analysis_file.py for details about the information\n    needed by this analysis.\n\n    Parameters:\n      targets: a list of the targets from the current compile run whose\n         dependencies should be analyzed.\n    Returns: a target-to-target mapping from targets to targets that they depend on.\n       If this was already computed, return the already computed result.\n    '
