'Generic interfaces for record-based IO streams.\n\nThis module contains a RecordIO specification which defines interfaces for reading and writing to\nsequential record streams using codecs. A record consists of a header (containing the length of the\nframe), and a frame containing the encoded data.\n\nTo create a new RecordIO implementation, subclass RecordReader, RecordWriter, and Codec.\nA basic example, StringRecordIO, is provided.\n\n'
