Fortunately these cases aren't as fragile\n    as a completely missing dependency. It's still a good idea to have explicit direct deps where relevant,\n    so we optionally warn about indirect deps, to make them easy to find and reason about.\n\n    - actual_deps: a map src -> list of actual deps (source, class or jar file) as noted by the compiler.\n\n    Returns a triple (missing_file_deps, missing_tgt_deps, missing_direct_tgt_deps) where:\n\n    - missing_file_deps: a list of pairs (src_tgt, dep_file) where src_tgt requires dep_file, and we're\n      unable to map to a target (because its target isn't in the total set of targets in play, and we\n      don't want to parse every BUILD file in the workspace just to find it).\n\n    - missing_tgt_deps: a list of pairs (src_tgt, dep_tgt) where src_tgt is missing a necessary\n                        transitive dependency on dep_tgt.\n\n    - missing_direct_tgt_deps: a list of pairs (src_tgt, dep_tgt) where src_tgt is missing a direct\n                               dependency on dep_tgt but has a transitive dep on it.\n\n    All paths in the input and output are absolute.\n    "
